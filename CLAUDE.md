Use Minimal comments where possible.
Follow the existing principals and code styling.

Client uses node + npm things.
Server uses bun things, like bun install etc. Don't mix these up.

client folder refers to client application.
server folder refers to server application.

DO NOT install or use ROOT for anything, each application serves differently.
